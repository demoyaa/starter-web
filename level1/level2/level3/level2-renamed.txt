The trouble with programmers is that you can never tell what a programmer is doing until it’s too late. (Seymour Cray) The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should therefore be regarded as a criminal offense. (E.W. Dijkstra) A programmer is a person who passes as an exacting expert on the basis of being able to turn out, after innumerable punching, an infinite series of incomprehensive answers calculated with micrometric precisions from vague assumptions based on debatable figures taken from inconclusive documents and carried out on instruments of problematical accuracy by persons of dubious reliability and questionable mentality for the avowed purpose of annoying and confounding a hopelessly defenseless department that was unfortunate enough to ask for the information in the first place. (IEEE Grid newsmagazine) I think Microsoft named .Net so it wouldn’t show up in a Unix directory listing. (Oktal)

That’s the thing about people who think they hate computers. What they really hate is lousy programmers. (Larry Niven) There are only two industries that refer to their customers as ‘users’. (Edward Tufte) The best method for accelerating a computer is the one that boosts it by 9.8 m/s2. (Anonymous) The question of whether computers can think is like the question of whether submarines can swim. (Edsger W. Dijkstra)

One man’s crappy software is another man’s full-time job. (Jessica Gaston) Good programmers use their brains, but good guidelines save us having to think out every case. (Francis Glassborow) The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off by a bit. (Anonymous) Complexity kills. It sucks the life out of developers, it makes products difficult to plan, build and test, it introduces security challenges, and it causes end-user and administrator frustration. (Ray Ozzie) If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. (Edsger Dijkstra)
