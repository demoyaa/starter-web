Programming is like sex. One mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life. (Michael Sinz) There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. (C.A.R. Hoare) I’ve finally learned what ‘upward compatible’ means. It means we get to keep all our old mistakes. (Dennie van Tassel) Don’t worry if it doesn’t work right. If everything did, you’d be out of a job. (Mosher’s Law of Software Engineering) Optimism is an occupational hazard of programming; feedback is the treatment. (Kent Beck)

Should array indices start at 0 or 1? My compromise of 0.5 was rejected without, I thought, proper consideration. (Stan Kelly-Bootle) The best programmers are not marginally better than merely good ones. They are an order-of-magnitude better, measured by whatever standard: conceptual creativity, speed, ingenuity of design, or problem-solving ability. (Randall E. Stross) Good code is its own best documentation. (Steve McConnell) I think Microsoft named .Net so it wouldn’t show up in a Unix directory listing. (Oktal) The trouble with programmers is that you can never tell what a programmer is doing until it’s too late. (Seymour Cray)

Every operating system out there is about equal… We all suck. (Microsoft senior vice president Brian Valentine describing the state of the art in OS security, 2003) I don’t care if it works on your machine! We are not shipping your machine! (Vidiu Platon) The cheapest, fastest, and most reliable components are those that aren’t there. (Gordon Bell) A computer lets you make more mistakes faster than any invention in human history–with the possible exceptions of handguns and tequila. (Mitch Radcliffe) One of the main causes of the fall of the Roman Empire was that–lacking zero–they had no way to indicate successful termination of their C programs. (Robert Firth)

Computers are useless. They can only give you answers. (Pablo Picasso) There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works. (Alan J. Perlis) Complexity kills. It sucks the life out of developers, it makes products difficult to plan, build and test, it introduces security challenges, and it causes end-user and administrator frustration. (Ray Ozzie) The only people who have anything to fear from free software are those whose products are worth even less. (David Emery)
