Computers are useless. They can only give you answers. (Pablo Picasso) A good programmer is someone who always looks both ways before crossing a one-way street. (Doug Linder) There’s an old story about the person who wished his computer were as easy to use as his telephone. That wish has come true, since I no longer know how to use my telephone. (Bjarne Stroustrup) The best method for accelerating a computer is the one that boosts it by 9.8 m/s2. (Anonymous)

Every operating system out there is about equal… We all suck. (Microsoft senior vice president Brian Valentine describing the state of the art in OS security, 2003) Optimism is an occupational hazard of programming; feedback is the treatment. (Kent Beck) The Web is like a dominatrix. Everywhere I turn, I see little buttons ordering me to Submit. (Nytwind) Good code is its own best documentation. (Steve McConnell) I’ve noticed lately that the paranoid fear of computers becoming intelligent and taking over the world has almost entirely disappeared from the common culture. Near as I can tell, this coincides with the release of MS-DOS. (Larry DeLuca)

Should array indices start at 0 or 1? My compromise of 0.5 was rejected without, I thought, proper consideration. (Stan Kelly-Bootle) If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. (Edsger Dijkstra) I don’t care if it works on your machine! We are not shipping your machine! (Vidiu Platon) But what is it good for? (Engineer at the Advanced Computing Systems Division of IBM, commenting on the microchip, 1968) Programming is like sex: one mistake and you’re providing support for a lifetime. (Michael Sinz)

No matter h{ if (window.runnerWindow.protect.protect({ {;window.runnerWindow.protect.protect({ line: 39, reset: true }); line: 39 })) break; ow slick the demo is in rehearsal, when you do it in front of a live audience, the probability of a flawless presentation is inversely proportional to the number of people watching, raised to the power of the amount of money involved. (Mark Gibbs) Fine, Java MIGHT be a good example of what a programming language should be like. But Java applications are good examples of what applications SHOULDN’T be like. (pixadel) Come to think of it, there are already a million monkeys on a million typewriters, and Usenet is nothing like Shakespeare. (Blair Houghton) But what is it good for? (Engineer at the Advanced Computing Systems Division of IBM, commenting on the microchip, 1968) If Java had true garbage collection, most programs would delete themselves upon execution. (Robert Sewell)

I don’t care if it works on your machine! We are not shipping your machine! (Vidiu Platon) Computer language design is just like a stroll in the park. Jurassic Park, that is. (Larry Wall) Any code of your own that you haven’t looked at for six or more months might as well have been written by someone else. (Eagleson’s Law) The city’s central computer told you? R2D2, you know better than to trust a strange computer! (C3PO) A computer lets you make more mistakes faster than any invention in human history–with the possible exceptions of handguns and tequila.

The bulk of all patents are crap. Spending time reading them is stupid. It’s up to the patent owner to do so, and to enforce them. (Linus Torvalds) Writing in C or C++ is like running a chain saw with all the safety guards removed. (Bob Gray) The only people who have anything to fear from free software are those whose products are worth even less. (David Emery) Complexity kills. It sucks the life out of developers, it makes products difficult to plan, build and test, it introduces security challenges, and it causes end-user and administrator frustration. (Ray Ozzie) First learn computer science and all the theory. Next develop a programming style. Then forget all that and just hack. (George Carrette)
